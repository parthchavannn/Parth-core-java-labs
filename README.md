## Lab 1: Flow Control/Operators/Assignments

This lab covers basic flow control, operators, and assignments in Java. Exercises include:

1. **Exercise 1:** Calculate the sum of the cubes of the digits of an n-digit number.
2. **Exercise 2:** Simulate a traffic light using int inputs.
3. **Exercise 3:** Compute the nth Fibonacci number using recursive and non-recursive methods.
4. **Exercise 4:** Print all prime numbers up to a given integer.
5. **Exercise 5:** Calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers divisible by 3 or 5.
6. **Exercise 6:** Find the difference between the sum of the squares and the square of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
7. **Exercise 7:** Create a method to check if a number is an increasing number.
8. **Exercise 8:** Check if a number is a power of two.

## Lab 2: Collections Framework

This lab focuses on the Collections Framework in Java. Exercises include:

1. **Exercise 1:** Create a method which accepts an array of integer elements and returns the second smallest element in the array.
2. **Exercise 2:** Create a method that can accept an array of String objects and sort them in alphabetical order, with elements in the left half in uppercase and the right half in lowercase.
3. **Exercise 3:** Create a method which accepts an integer array, reverses the numbers, and returns the resulting array in sorted order.
4. **Exercise 4:** Create a method which accepts an integer array and removes all duplicates, returning the resulting array in descending order.

## Lab 3: Strings and Parsing

This lab involves string manipulation and parsing. Exercises include:

1. **Exercise 1:** Write a Java program that reads a line of integers and then displays each integer and the sum of all integers.
2. **Exercise 2:** Create a class containing a method to create the mirror image of a String. The method should return the two Strings separated by a pipe (`|`) symbol.
3. **Exercise 3:** Create a method which accepts a String and replaces all consonants with the next alphabet.
4. **Exercise 4:** Create a method that accepts a number and modifies it such that each digit in the newly formed number is equal to the difference between two consecutive digits in the original number.
5. **Exercise 5:** Write a Java program that displays the number of characters, lines, and words in a text.
6. **Exercise 8:** Create a method that accepts a String and checks if it is a positive string, where each character comes after the previous one alphabetically.
7. **Exercise 9:** Create a method to accept a date and print the duration in days, months, and years with respect to the current system date.

## Lab 4: Inheritance and Polymorphism

This lab focuses on inheritance and polymorphism in Java. Exercises include:

1. **Exercise 1:** Create `Person` and `Account` classes, ensuring a minimum balance of INR 500 in a bank account is maintained. Implement `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount` classes with specific features.
2. **Exercise 2:** Create packages and classes for an Employee Insurance System with specific attributes and services.
3. **Exercise 3:** Using an inheritance hierarchy, design a Java program to model library items (books, journal articles, videos, and CDs). Implement an abstract superclass `Item` and its subclasses: `WrittenItem` (with `Book` and `JournalPaper`), and `MediaItem` (with `Video` and `CD`).

## Lab 5: Exception Handling

This lab covers exception handling in Java. Exercises include:

1. **Exercise 1:** Validate the age of a person using a user-defined exception. The age should be above 15.
2. **Exercise 2:** Validate the full name of an employee using a user-defined exception if the first name and last name are blank.
3. **Exercise 3:** Create an `EmployeeException` class and handle exceptions if the salary of an employee is below 3000.

## Lab 6: Collection Framework

This lab involves advanced use of the Collection Framework. Exercises include:

1. **Exercise 1:** Create a method which accepts a HashMap and returns the values sorted in a List.
2. **Exercise 2:** Create a method that accepts a character array and counts the number of times each character is present in the array.
3. **Exercise 3:** Create a method which accepts an array of numbers and returns a HashMap of the numbers and their squares.
4. **Exercise 4:** Write a function to determine which students are eligible for medals based on their marks.
5. **Exercise 5:** Create a method which accepts an array of integer elements and returns the second smallest element in the array.
6. **Exercise 6:** Create a method which accepts a Map of IDs and ages and returns a list of eligible voters based on age.

## Lab 9: Lambda Expressions and Stream API

This lab explores lambda expressions and the Stream API. Exercises include:

1. **Exercise 1:** Write a lambda expression that accepts two numbers and returns their product.
2. **Exercise 2:** Write a method using a lambda expression to format a given string, inserting a space between each character.
3. **Exercise 3:** Write a method using a lambda expression to accept a username and password, returning true or false based on authentication.
4. **Exercise 4:** Demonstrate instance creation using method reference in a simple class.
5. **Exercise 5:** Write a method to calculate the factorial of a number and test it using method reference.
