## Lab 1: Flow Control/Operators/Assignments

This lab covers basic flow control, operators, and assignments in Java. Exercises include:

1. **Exercise 1:** Calculate the sum of the cubes of the digits of an n-digit number.
2. **Exercise 2:** Simulate a traffic light using int inputs.
3. **Exercise 3:** Compute the nth Fibonacci number using recursive and non-recursive methods.
4. **Exercise 4:** Print all prime numbers up to a given integer.
5. **Exercise 5:** Calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers divisible by 3 or 5.
6. **Exercise 6:** Find the difference between the sum of the squares and the square of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
7. **Exercise 8:** Check if a number is a power of two.

## Lab 2: Collections Framework

This lab focuses on Java Collections Framework, including handling HashMaps, Lists, and arrays. Exercises include:

1. **Exercise 1:** Return the values of a HashMap in sorted order as a List.
2. **Exercise 2:** Count the occurrences of each character in a character array.
3. **Exercise 3:** Return numbers and their squares from an array in a HashMap.
4. **Exercise 4:** Determine the type of medal for students based on their marks.
5. **Exercise 5:** Get the second smallest element in an integer array.
6. **Exercise 6:** Generate a list of eligible voters based on age.

## Lab 3: Strings and Parsing

This lab involves various string manipulation and parsing tasks. Exercises include:

1. **Exercise 1:** Read a line of integers, display each integer, and compute the sum.
2. **Exercise 2:** Create a mirror image of a string and return it separated by a pipe (`|`).
3. **Exercise 3:** Replace consonants in a string with the next alphabet.
4. **Exercise 4:** Modify a number based on the difference between consecutive digits.
5. **Exercise 5:** Count characters, lines, and words in a text.
6. **Exercise 8:** Check if a string is a positive string (characters are in alphabetical order).
7. **Exercise 9:** Print the duration in days, months, and years from a given date to the current system date.

## Lab 4: Inheritance and Polymorphism

This lab demonstrates the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism in Java. Exercises include:

1. **Exercise 1:** Create classes for Person and Account, and extend functionality with SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount. Implement account operations with specific constraints.
2. **Exercise 2:** Implement a simple Employee Insurance System with packages for employee details, services, and user interactions.
3. **Exercise 3:** Model library items using an abstract superclass and various subclasses for books, journal papers, videos, and CDs.

## Lab 5: Exception Handling

This lab focuses on creating and handling custom exceptions in Java. Exercises include:

1. **Exercise 1:** Validate age with a custom exception.
2. **Exercise 2:** Validate employee name with a custom exception.
3. **Exercise 3:** Create and handle an `EmployeeException` for salary validation.

## Lab 6: Collection Framework

Additional exercises for practicing collection frameworks:

1. **Exercise 1:** Reverse and sort an integer array.
2. **Exercise 2:** Count character occurrences in an array.
3. **Exercise 3:** Map numbers to their squares.
4. **Exercise 4:** Determine medal eligibility based on student marks.
5. **Exercise 5:** Find the second smallest element in an array.
6. **Exercise 6:** List IDs of eligible voters based on age.

## Lab 9: Lambda Expressions and Stream API

This lab explores lambda expressions and the Stream API:

1. **Exercise 1:** Lambda expression to return the product of two numbers.
2. **Exercise 2:** Format a string with spaces between characters using lambda expressions.
3. **Exercise 3:** Authenticate username and password with lambda expressions.
4. **Exercise 4:** Demonstrate instance creation using method references.
5. **Exercise 5:** Calculate factorial using method reference.
